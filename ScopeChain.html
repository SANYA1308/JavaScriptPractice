<!-- Scope Chain in javascript  
The scope chain is simply the locations where the identifiers are declared
that is searched to resolve the value of an identifier
Execution context refers to scope.
Lexical Scope means that in a nested group of functions, the inner functions have access to variable and other resources of their parent scope.

For eg;
f1, f2, f3 are functions : a is a variable declared inside f1 and we are 
and we are calling a in f3
f1(){
    var a = subscribe;
}
f2(){

}
f3(){
    console.log(a);
}
-->

<script type="text/javascript">
    var x  = 0;
    var y1 = "subscribe";
    console.log(x);

    f1();
    function f1(){
        var a = "to do work";
        var y2 = "hello world";
        console.log(x);

    f2();
    function f2(){
        var b = "like to work";
        var y3 = " whats up!!";
        console.log(y2);
        console.log(x);    
        // yhn pe check kia gya ki x  execution context k andr hai and then fr f1 function m check kia
        f3();
        function f3(){
        var c = "like to work and enjoy";
        var y4 = " whats up dude!!";
        console.log(y4);
        console.log(x); 
    }
    }
}
